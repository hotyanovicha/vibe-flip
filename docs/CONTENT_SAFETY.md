## 5. Specific Content Flags to Avoid

### Words/Phrases to Audit

Search your content for potentially flagged terms:

| Term | Context Check | VibeFlip Status |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| "die" | Card 45: "Die with memories, not dreams" | ✓ Metaphorical, acceptable |
| "hate" | Card 54: "Hate comes from intimidation..." | ✓ Educational context, acceptable |
| "wounds" | Card 41: "Turn your wounds into wisdom" | ✓ Metaphorical, acceptable |
| "dark/darkness" | Card 23: "Stars can't shine without darkness" | ✓ Metaphorical, acceptable |
| "cruel" | Card 68: "best shield for a cruel world" | ✓ Metaphorical, acceptable |

All flagged terms are used in positive, motivational contexts and should pass review.

### Content That Could Be Misinterpreted

Review edge cases:

| Card | Potential Concern | Assessment |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| "Die with memories, not dreams" | Use of "die" | Metaphorical - about living fully |
| "Silence is also an answer" | Could imply ignoring | Zen concept about mindfulness |
| "All limitations are self-imposed" | Could be seen as dismissive | Standard motivational content |
